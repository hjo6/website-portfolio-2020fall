        <div class="about-me">Hello and welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Hunter, I'm a Computer Science major with a minor in music. My purpose in creating this website is in reflecting on the incredible opportunities I've had throughout my life and the amazing people that I have met along the way. Generally speaking, I plan on using this website as a sort of repository for both my school and personal projects, while also including some biographical information regarding my life. For information about this (rough) draft, <a href="https://github.com/hjo6/website-portfolio-2020fall/blob/master/README.md">click here for the readme!</a></div>
