# Final Project

### Goals and Ideas
For my final project, I want to continue working towards making my website portfolio into a complete and functioning repository for any work that I want to showcase for job applications. Ideally, this includes working on previous ideas that I didn't have time to implement, finding new fonts, finding at least 1 new color palette, and other cosmetic changes that I would like to iron out. I have already come up with more "stretch goal" ideas that I would love to implement if I can find the time. Since I plan to continue working on this website after I graduate, I'm aware that some ideas will have to be left on the chopping block for now. I've compiled a sort of task list for my project.

### Task List:
Ideas for website revision:
- Add horizontal and vertical tab system
- Separate projects page into 2 distinct pages
- Add "animations" to tabs to make content presentation pop
- Update and/or add a new color palette
- Update fonts
- More fleshed out repository
  - Find way to demo code?
  - Determine how to present code
- Resume
- Make homepage more interesting
  - Some kind of animation? Gallery-style image preview?
  - Some kind of interactivity with the user?
- Add Spotify links to song lyrics
- Optimize images
- Add more details to influences and experiences pages
- Reformat/restructure site using mobile-first development methodology
- Add some form of contact/interaction
  - Social Media?
  - E-mail?
  - Comment section?
- Create a page where visitors can somehow add to the website
