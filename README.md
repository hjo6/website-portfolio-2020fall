# Final Project

#### Goals and Ideas
For my final project, I want to continue working towards making my website portfolio into a complete and functioning repository for any work that I want to showcase for job applications. Ideally, this includes working on previous ideas that I didn't have time to implement, finding new fonts, finding at least 1 new color palette, and other cosmetic changes that I would like to iron out. I have already come up with more "stretch goal" ideas that I would love to implement if I can find the time. Since I plan to continue working on this website after I graduate, I'm aware that some ideas will have to be left on the chopping block for now. I've compiled a sort of task list for my project.

## Task Lists:
#### Minimum Goals for Website Revision:
- Add horizontal and vertical tab system
- Separate "Projects" page into 2 distinct pages
  - Add more content to each page to justify change
- Add "animations" to tabs to make content presentation pop
- Update and/or add a new color palette
- Update fonts
- More fleshed out repository
  - Find way to demo code?
  - Determine how to present code
- Resume
- Add some form of contact/interaction
  - Social Media?
  - E-mail?
  - Comment section?

#### Stretch Goals for Website Revision:
- Make homepage more interesting
  - Some kind of animation? Gallery-style image preview?
  - Some kind of interactivity with the user?
- Add Spotify links to song lyrics
- Optimize images
- Add more details to influences and experiences pages
- Reformat/restructure site using mobile-first development methodology
- Create a page where visitors can somehow add to the website

## Draft Progress
For the full-as-possible draft for Thursday 11/19/20, I present a more complete version of my website. While I haven't been able to make as much progress as I would have liked, I think the progress I have made has been in pretty big steps. I got the vertical/horizontal tab system fully functional on my projects page; this took a lot of working out how to animate the tabs using JavaScript. There are still some functions I would like to compress to make more generally usable, but for now, the fact that only one tab can open at a time is a success to me! Before, you would be able to open any number of tabs at the same time, which would get really confusing really quickly if you didn't understand what was happening.

I was also able to integrate a dark theme. This also took more work than I had anticipated. My main issue was that I was trying to use JavaScript to add the dark theme stylesheet as a link in the head of my HTML doc, but really I only needed to use the @media that InternetingIsHard touched on. With this in mind, your browser will automatically detect what "mode" your computer or browser is on (light theme or dark theme), and depending on which theme is set, you will get a different color palette. I kept the original color palette as the light theme because I simply like the color palette I came up with there. I am open to suggestions on changing either palette, I haven't been able to get too much feedback on that.

Another change was the addition of fonts. This was present on the first draft due on Tuesday, but I figured it was worth mentioning because, like I had originally hypothesized in my final reflection for the website portfolio unit, a nice font can take a website to the next level. I really do think that the font added a lot of character to the webpage!

I was really hoping to be able to get a version of my code repository up and running, but the other features that I worked on took far more time than I had wanted them to, so I was unable to get that far. Going forward, I don't think that there is anything too difficult to implement (knock on wood), so it's a matter of working through my checklists now and adding all that I can. I'm very open to any kind of suggestion, whether that be to changes of what I already have presented or additional features that would be interesting or unique!
