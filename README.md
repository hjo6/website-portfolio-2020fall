For my rough draft, I present a very rough idea of how I want to present the information on my website. I haven't quite gotten to working on my "repository" sections of the website, so I might have to move those as a stretch goal. As for what I do have, I have my home page, an influences page, and an experiences page. I have yet to add any photos to either the influences or experiences page as I still must figure out how to present the images within each respective "tab." Since I have to keep the content hidden, I have to figure out using floats how best to add the photos and where they will flow best on the page. As for the content, I have very rough drafts of what I think I want to say for each "tab." I plan on going into further details on both pages, but for now I wanted to get a rough idea of what I want to convey. I would like to host links to Spotify of my favorite songs from my music influences, but need to look further into if I would be able to do that.
