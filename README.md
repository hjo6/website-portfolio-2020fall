# Final Project

#### Goals and Ideas
For my final project, I want to continue working towards making my website portfolio into a complete and functioning repository for any work that I want to showcase for job applications. Ideally, this includes working on previous ideas that I didn't have time to implement, finding new fonts, finding at least 1 new color palette, and other cosmetic changes that I would like to iron out. I have already come up with more "stretch goal" ideas that I would love to implement if I can find the time. Since I plan to continue working on this website after I graduate, I'm aware that some ideas will have to be left on the chopping block for now. I've compiled a sort of task list for my project.

## Task Lists:
#### Minimum Goals for Website Revision:
- Add horizontal and vertical tab system
- ~~Separate "Projects" page into 2 distinct pages~~
  - Add more content to each page to justify change **(This is the reason for dropping the above requirement; the lack of content on each page if they were to be separated)**
- Add "animations" to tabs to make content presentation pop
- Update and/or add a new color palette
- Update fonts
- More fleshed out repository
  - Find way to demo code?
  - Determine how to present code
- ~~Resume~~ **(Scrapped for redundancy: those that will have access to the site in the future will have gotten access from the link on my resume. )**
- Add some form of contact/interaction
  - Social Media?
  - E-mail?
  - ~~Comment section?~~ **(Does not really fit the theme for what I plan to use this website for)**

#### Stretch Goals for Website Revision:
- Make homepage more interesting
  - Some kind of animation? Gallery-style image preview?
  - Some kind of interactivity with the user?
- Add Spotify links to song lyrics
- Optimize images
- Add more details to influences and experiences pages
- Reformat/restructure site using mobile-first development methodology
- Create a page where visitors can somehow add to the website

## Draft Progress
For the full-as-possible draft for Thursday 11/19/20, I present a more complete version of my website. While I haven't been able to make as much progress as I would have liked, I think the progress I have made has been in pretty big steps. I got the vertical/horizontal tab system fully functional on my projects page; this took a lot of working out how to animate the tabs using JavaScript. There are still some functions I would like to compress to make more generally usable, but for now, the fact that only one tab can open at a time is a success to me! Before, you would be able to open any number of tabs at the same time, which would get really confusing really quickly if you didn't understand what was happening.

I was also able to integrate a dark theme. This also took more work than I had anticipated. My main issue was that I was trying to use JavaScript to add the dark theme stylesheet as a link in the head of my HTML doc, but really I only needed to use the @media that InternetingIsHard touched on. With this in mind, your browser will automatically detect what "mode" your computer or browser is on (light theme or dark theme), and depending on which theme is set, you will get a different color palette. I kept the original color palette as the light theme because I simply like the color palette I came up with there. I am open to suggestions on changing either palette, I haven't been able to get too much feedback on that.

Another change was the addition of fonts. This was present on the first draft due on Tuesday, but I figured it was worth mentioning because, like I had originally hypothesized in my final reflection for the website portfolio unit, a nice font can take a website to the next level. I really do think that the font added a lot of character to the webpage!

I was really hoping to be able to get a version of my code repository up and running, but the other features that I worked on took far more time than I had wanted them to, so I was unable to get that far. Going forward, I don't think that there is anything too difficult to implement (knock on wood), so it's a matter of working through my checklists now and adding all that I can. I'm very open to any kind of suggestion, whether that be to changes of what I already have presented or additional features that would be interesting or unique!

## Final Submission Progress
After a hectic week before finals, I was finally able to come back and work more on the final consolidation project. The past week or so has been incredibly fast paced, busy, and stressful; the only reason I bring this up is because it does in fact affect this project! At my last Capstone project team meeting, our project sponsor encouraged us to look into the Pitt BS+MS program, which would allow us to pursue our Masters degree in CS in only 2 semesters. Since hearing about this opportunity, I've been battling with whether it is the right fit for me--I have ultimately concluded that this is the perfect time for me to further my academic career. With this in mind, it changes the scope of my consolidation project.

Initially, this website was to be used as a sort of portfolio for potential employers to learn about me more intimately and see the work I've done towards my career. I still plan to use this website as a personal website, but I think that I'll be focused more on experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the present, while in the future I'll use this website as a reference or do an overhaul down the line to fulfill all of the requirements I have still yet to figure out.

As it stands, I have put in a considerable amount of work since the website portfolio project: I have found two fonts to use for my text, I have used more JavaScript in order to animate the tabs on my pages to open fluidly (animating the closing of the tabs still needs implemented, I could not figure out the most efficient way to do it), and I created my own dark theme color palette in addition to the regular color palette I originally created.

While the modifications do not seem like a lot of work, figuring out the JavaScript for all of the tab animations took the better part of ~10 hours of total work. I'm including my initial trials and errors because they were the foundations to figuring out the horizontal/vertical tab system. As I have previously noted, even with this time and effort put into the functionality, I still don't have the animations perfect for closing the tabs. If you close the tab you are currently viewing, it will nicely slide the content out of the panel. However, if you click a different tab while a tab is already open, it will just immediately hide the currently displayed tab, and then do the opening animation for the new tab. It works and is functional, but with later work I would love to figure out how to make all of the animations consistent.

The color palette even took me a long time to figure out. I went through every page of my website and noted the color of the original color palette. I then numbered the colors on a scale of 1-6 to determine the "depth" of each of the elements. I then decided I wanted to go with a blue dark theme, so I looked around at color palettes online to get an idea of what I wanted out of my website. When I found a color palette I liked, I tried using my number system to implement the new colors in their appropriate places. However, this turned out to be much more complicated than I had originally intended. I liked the tone of one of the blues in the palette, so I got additional information regarding that specific shade of blue, and then created a color palette based on the different shades and tints that the website provided for that color. I will be using this website again for any color design needs; the specific color and page I used can be found [at this link](https://www.color-hex.com/color/0e2a62).

The fonts did not give me much grief. I wanted a font that was professional, modern, yet also had a bit of my own personality. The header font accomplishes this perfectly, I feel. I used the Goldman 'cursive' font that I found on Google fonts; after choosing this font, I realized that it somewhat resembled the font of an album I have been listening to a lot lately (All That You Can't Leave Behind by U2). For the paragraph text, I used another font I found on Google Fonts called Montserrat 'sans-serif.' I chose this text because I felt that it balanced the personality of the header text nicely; it's a more professional and traditional font that works well for the smaller text.
