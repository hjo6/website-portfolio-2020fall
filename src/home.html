        <div class="about-me">Hello and welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Hunter, I'm a Computer Science major with a minor in music. My purpose in creating this website is in reflecting on the incredible opportunities I've had throughout my life and the amazing people that I have met along the way. Generally speaking, I plan on using this website as a sort of repository for both my school and personal projects, while also including some biographical information regarding my life.</div>
